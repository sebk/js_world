* JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
* ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
* ECMAScript versions have been abbreviated to ES1, ES2, ES3, ES5, and ES6. 
* Since 2016 new versions are named by year (ECMAScript 2016 / 2017 / 2018 ...).

# ES6
